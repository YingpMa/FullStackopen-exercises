# Course Information Application (Exercises 1.1–1.5)

This repository contains my solution for **Full Stack Open** exercises 1.1–1.5. The application displays course information, including parts and their exercise counts, and evolves step by step through the exercises.

## Implementation Progress

- **1.1**: Created a basic React app to display course details and exercise totals.
- **1.2**: Refactored into components: `Header`, `Content`, and `Total`.
- **1.3**: Organized course data into objects.
- **1.4**: Consolidated objects into an array for better structure.
- **1.5**: Combined course name and parts into a single object.
